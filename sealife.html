                  <p class="card-text">there are 3,800 big thermometers floating in the ocean, and the readings don't lie: Over 90 percent of the warming created by humans is soaked up by the seas. Unsurprisingly, many creatures are feeling the heat. 
                    In new research published Wednesday in the journal Nature, scientists found that global warming has forced twice as many marine species than land species to vanish from their hotter habitats —particularly near the already balmy equator. All the species examined were cold-blooded, or ectotherms.
                    "What we found so surprising is that global warming hits sea creatures the hardest," said Malin Pinsky, an evolutionary ecologist at Rutgers University and lead author of the research.
                    From one perspective, it's surprising because it gets so much hotter on land. "The ocean never gets that hot," noted Pinksy. Sea critters, then, aren't adapted to deal with such significant temperature increases. And that's the problem.
                    "That's their Achilles heel," said Pinsky. 
                    As temperatures warm, especially in the already hot tropics, creatures can't tolerate the heat, and leave. What Pinksy and his team found were local extinctions, meaning over half of the 108 sea creatures they studied left their native homes and moved to cooler waters. Meanwhile about a quarter of land species — like species of lizards and geckos — left their homes as things heated up.</p>
